# DiscordBot

This bot is meant for programmers and all others which spend a lot of time in front of their screen. The purpose of this bot is to remind the user to not forget to hydrate and to stretch. This should help the user to maintain these two things while working on the computer. 

By now the bot reminds the user every 30 minutes alternately to ether hydrate or stretch by default, however, the user can also set a custome time via the command mentioned below. The bot chooses its response from a pool of messages to avoid dull behavior.

The bot reacts on five commands by now.  
`!on` activates the bot  
`!off` deactivates the bot  
`!set_time` set a custome reminder time in minutes  
`!help` provides information on how to use the bot and its commands  
`!info` provides information about the bot and what it's supposed to do
