# DiscordBot

This bot is meant for programmers and all others which spend a lot of time in front of their screen. The purpose of this bot is to remind the user to not forget to hydrate and to stretch. This should help the user to maintain these two things while working on the computer.

The bot reacts on three commands by now.  
`!on` activates the bot  
`!off` deactivates the bot  
`!help` provides information on how to use the bot and its commands
`!info` provides information about the bot and what it's supposed to do
